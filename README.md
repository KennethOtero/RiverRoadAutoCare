# RiverRoadAutoCare
This capstone project provided a software solution for a small automotive repair shop named River Road Auto Care. It was a collaborative effort between myself, Kevin Koehler, Samuel Howard, and Shamonnie Guilford. The website provides the business with a way to advertise themselves, which includes their address, contact information, an 'about us' page, the services they provide, and a reviews section. The website also has the ability for customers to create an account and use a calendar scheduler to schedule future jobs.
