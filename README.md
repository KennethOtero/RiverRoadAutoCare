# River Road Auto Care Website

*Note: The website was hosted at Cincinnati State, and as I am no longer a student there, it has been taken offline. If you'd like a quick demo of the website, you can find a video here: https://youtu.be/X4gnrcPnLkc*

## About
This capstone project provided a software solution for a small automotive repair shop named River Road Auto Care. It was a collaborative effort between myself, Kevin Koehler, Samuel Howard, and Shamonnie Guilford. The website provides the business with a way to advertise themselves, which includes their address, contact information, an 'about us' page, the services they provide, and a reviews section. The website also has the ability for customers to create an account and use a calendar scheduler to schedule future jobs.

## My Contribution
I developed the database for the application, as well as the home page, services, reset password, and review pages. I also created the front end of all of the website's forms, such as update/add user information.
