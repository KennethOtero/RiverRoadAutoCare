# RiverRoadAutoCare
This capstone project provided a software solution for a small automotive repair shop named River Road Auto Care. It was a collaborative effort between myself, Kevin Koehler, Samuel Howard, and Shamonnie Guilford. The website provides the business with a way to advertise themselves, which includes their address, contact information, an 'about us' page, the services they provide, and a reviews section. The website also has the ability for customers to create an account and use a calendar scheduler to schedule future jobs.

I developed the database for the application, as well as the home page, services, reset password, and review pages. I also created the front end of all the forms, such as update/add user information. 

You can find the website here: http://itd1.cincinnatistate.edu/CPDM-OteroK/ 
Note: The website is currently hosted at Cincinnati State, and as a former student it may be taken offline. If this is the case, you can find a demo here: https://youtu.be/X4gnrcPnLkc
